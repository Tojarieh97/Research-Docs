    \begin{abstract}
        In quantum mechanics, mutually unbiased bases (MUB) are sets of quantum states that are as
        different as possible from one another in terms of the information that can be obtained from measuring them.
        MUB provide a powerful tool for characterizing quantum states and can be used to efficiently obtain an energy
        landscape of optimization problems.
        The energy landscape serves as a tool for the optimization problem and helps identify the global
        minimum solution.
        By combining MUB with machine learning techniques, the optimization process can be improved by reducing the
        number of search steps required to find the optimal solution.
        This proposal presents an overview about our idea to use MUB in solving optimization problems and highlights the problems space this approach will solve.

    \section{Introduction and Background}\label{sec:introduction-and-background}
    \input{introduction-and-background}


    \section{Related Work}\label{sec:related-work}
    There are few parers about using quantum annealing to solve those kind of optimization problems, that are intractable
    for classical computers.
    Quantum Annealing (QA) is a method for solving optimization problems that is inspired by the process of annealing in
    metallurgy.
    Like classical simulated annealing, it is a method that uses a random search to find the global minimum
    of an energy function, but it uses the principles of quantum mechanics to guide the search.
    In QA, the optimization problem is mapped to a physical system, called the quantum annealer,
    which consists of a large number of interacting quantum bits (qubits).
    The energy function of the optimization problem is encoded into the Hamiltonian of the quantum annealer,
    and the ground state of the Hamiltonian corresponds to the optimal solution of the problem.

    The quantum annealer is initialized in a high-energy state,
    and then it is slowly cooled down to its ground state by applying a time-dependent Hamiltonian.
    The cooling process is guided by a schedule that controls the rate of change of the Hamiltonian.
    The schedule is designed to avoid getting stuck in local minima and to increase the chances of finding the global minimum.


    \section{Objectives of the Research}\label{sec:objectives-of-the-research}
    The purpose of the M.Sc. research is to configure a way to draw the energy landscape of a quantum system using MUB.
    Through that, a great number of realizations can be reached, for example avoid local minima and find the absolute minimum, avoid barren plateaus\@.
    In our research, we are going to focus on a problem which preoccupies the entire optimization world, the Vehicle Routing Problem.
    Although our research will focus on this problem as our quantum system, one can refer to almost any problem, when the usage of MUB as
    a standard tool for drawing the energy landscape will be proven.
    VRP can be modeled as a search for the global minimum of an energy function, when the energy function represents
    the cost of a particular solution, such as the total distance traveled by vehicles or the total time taken to visit
    all customers.
    The configuration space is defined by the possible routes and the assignments of customers to vehicles.
    The global minimum of the energy function corresponds to the optimal solution of the problem\@.
    The search in the energy space can be done by using machine learning model or neural networks, for the correct differential
    fluctuations needed in the angles of each quantum eigenstate of the mutually unbiased bases in use.

    \section{Other Research Directions}\label{sec:other-research-directions}
    In addition to our main research topic, Prof. Mor and I are collaborating on other research problems, both in the field
    of the usages of MUB in quantum computing, such as the combination of MUB in recent Variational Quantum Algorithms.
    We are also working on expanding Qandies \cite{lin2021quantum} \cite{lin2020quantum} \cite{mor2022digital} terminology usage for explaining other quantum key distribution protocols and quantum phenomenas such as
    entanglement-swapping and do delay-choice entanglement-swapping~\cite{ma2016delayed}.
